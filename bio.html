        <p>I chose these photos as they display how busy life in the city can be but also the peacefulness and tranquility of it.
            The modern achitecture and sheer size of some of the sky scrapers is crazy and the views from the upper floors of them would
            be amazing. Living in the city isn't for everyone however showing these photos to someone and showing them how beautiful it
            is and the amount going on, it might change their mind. From someone that lives in the countryside I deffinitely would like 
            to give living in the city, especially a big city like New York, a go!</p>
